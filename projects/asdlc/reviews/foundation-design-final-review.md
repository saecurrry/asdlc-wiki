# Final independent design and evidence delta review

Review ID: DESIGN-2026-10-05-02. Reviewer: independent `design_challenger` subagent, distinct from the author/orchestrator. Date: 5 October 2026. Verdict: **pass** for the scoped foundational design and final evidence narrative. New meaningful findings: **none**. Documents remain draft; human acceptance is pending.

This report reviews the delta from [initial design review](../baseline/planning/reviews/design-review.md), including the final report addition preserving smoke output and documenting local package installation. It supersedes that report's target manifest for the listed current versions. It does not grant project approval, treat synthetic inputs as ASDLC requirements or authorise later delivery stages.

Local fixture states are local runtime snapshots, not shared planning artefacts or approvals. The confirmed-brief copy has the same byte hash as the original supplied attachment in the initial review; source instructions have not been changed by their persistence.

## Independent checks and assessment

| Criterion | Evidence and assessment |
|---|---|
| Honest scope and source decisions | Requirements/backlog are unchanged. Updated architecture makes standards/patterns snapshots and input invalidation explicit and labels historical correction evidence stale. It retains single-host locking, manual Git sync, trusted caller attribution and unsupported later stages. No added business consent or remote URL appears. |
| Canonical records and correction integrity | Architecture now describes generated question/finding RAID, closing records after answers/pass, and stable proposals applied by the orchestrator. These claims agree with the final independently reviewed implementation delta. Historical correction context is clearly separate from current approval evidence. |
| Version-bound test evidence | Independently recomputed all **38** source-file hashes listed in test-run.json: **zero mismatches**. Its recorded command returned exit 0 and contains 20 named passing tests. The final implementation report also records 20 tests and binds current source versions. This delta reviewer inspected recorded evidence rather than rerunning the full suite. |
| Actual review outcome retained | Real-fixture-review.json returns changes_required with blocking DISC-SOURCE-001: an unsupported manager role and weekly measurement responsibility. The correction worker removes these assertions, preserves source links, returns two unanswered blocking measurement questions and does not claim review/approval. Both actual result identities/digests and the narrative are consistent. |
| Pause instead of invented answer/acceptance | Independently inspected real fixture canonical state and generated status: revision 7, awaiting_input, repairs 1/2, three recorded results, **zero approvals**, two unanswered questions. The report correctly describes this unfinished real business-input loop and does not present a fresh pass or approval. |
| Synthetic demonstration boundary | Inspected demo source and current canonical status. The demo explicitly uses fake reviews and synthetic attributed approval, resumes in a separate Python process before approval, exercises duplicate/wrong-hash/stale rejection and ends stale at revision 14 after changed inputs. The report and README clearly identify that synthetic acceptance as a fixture mechanism. |
| Real harness versus fake tests | Preserved smoke response contains the expected schema message and matches the local smoke result. Real challenger/correction output is retained separately. This reviewer did not rerun real Codex or independently recreate earlier shell permission failures; those remain executed author evidence. The docs describe them as separate from fake engine tests and do not treat help output as integration proof. |
| Installation and entrypoint | Executed local `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip show asdlc`: installed version 0.1.0 in the workspace virtual environment. Executed `.venv/Scripts/asdlc.exe --help`: exit 0 with the documented discovery commands. Inspected CLI argument definitions against README syntax. The documented normal-host/temp limitation introduces no new API runtime or authentication requirement. |
| Remaining gates and recovery | Updated build plan/report retain draft status and hold live delivery pending exact human acceptance. Unconfigured central wiki is explicitly a labelled fixture. Missing fixture measurement answers are not presented as a request to rediscover ASDLC. Unsupported downstream/code-evidence/parallel capabilities are clearly deferred. |

## Findings and review boundary

No new material omission, unsupported completion claim or contradiction was found in these versions. Therefore there are no finding IDs, severity/blocking assignments or required resolutions. Agent pass is distinct from human acceptance and does not close real fixture questions.

This review checks planning changes and consistency of the recorded evidence. Independent implementation challenge supplies code review; author evidence supplies the recorded real harness execution. Any target change requires an independent version-specific delta review rather than silently rebinding this report. Human approval of draft requirements/design/backlog and the increment remains unrecorded.

## Version provenance

Initial content came from the [preserved foundation source](../baseline/planning/reviews/design-final-review.md). Historical reviews bind their recorded source versions; moving/editing this working presentation does not create a new approval. Review manifests and links below still refer to their historical target artifacts.
