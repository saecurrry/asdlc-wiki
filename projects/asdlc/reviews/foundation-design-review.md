# Independent design review

Review ID: DESIGN-2026-10-05-01. Reviewer: independent `design_challenger` subagent, distinct from the author/orchestrator. Date: 5 October 2026. Verdict: **pass** for the scoped foundational design. Findings: **none**. This is agent review, not human approval; all target documents remain draft.

## Exact reviewed versions

Hashes are SHA-256 of the complete on-disk file bytes, including line endings. The targets were read before hashing; the report applies only while these hashes match.

The supplied brief establishes the requirements and authorises local foundational implementation. Its instruction supersedes the starter pack's proposed defaults and approval-before-build sequence. No human-approved version of these new planning documents was supplied; this review does not fabricate one. The wiki remains unconfigured, so the review concerns the explicitly labelled local fixture.

## Rubric and evidence

| Criterion | Evidence and assessment |
|---|---|
| Coverage of confirmed requirements | Requirements R01–R13 retain repository separation, all seven stages, challenger independence, short question rounds, BRD/HLD/story contracts, integrated testing, sprint reports, persistent records, exact versions, invalidation and installed Codex integration. Later-stage implementation is explicitly deferred rather than claimed complete. |
| No invented business consent | Requirements business rules prohibit invented agreement and automatic human acceptance. Architecture distinguishes trusted local actor attribution from authentication. Backlog line 16 limits current authorisation to foundation/fixture work; line 21 distinguishes synthetic fixture approvals from live human gates. |
| Storage ownership and recovery | Architecture lines 23–27 separate target source from the wiki, name the canonical JSON envelope, specify orchestrator-only transactions, kernel locking, optimistic revisions, schema validation, fsync/atomic replacement and regeneration after a view failure. Corrupt state is refused and human source documents are separate. These choices are feasible for the declared single-host scope. |
| Version integrity and independence | Architecture line 25 binds snapshots, inputs, dispatched identities and review hashes and invalidates discovery evidence when answers or inputs change. Lines 33–39 describe separate owner and challenger dispatches, bounded corrections and exact-hash human approval. Backlog S05–S06 require duplicate and identity rejection, escalation and stale approval checks. |
| First increment feasibility | Backlog S01–S03 provide a serial prerequisite chain for configuration, validated canonical state and restart/views, with concrete isolation, corruption, stale revision, interruption and competing-writer verification. S04–S07 then add the required discovery vertical slice. Later increments remain outlines, as requested. |
| Harness claims and evidence boundaries | Architecture line 44 records the inspected installed CLI interface and requires separate real smoke evidence. The fake adapter is explicitly limited to engine mechanics. This design review does not verify the actual harness execution or account availability; the planned smoke remains required. |
| Scope and operational limitations | The documents retain draft status, state that no live project delivery is authorised, avoid invented remote URLs and defer parallelism, Git synchronisation and later-stage invalidation implementation. The build plan specifies failure/recovery checks and independently challenged implementation evidence. |

## Findings and disposition

No material gap, contradiction or implementation-blocking ambiguity was found in these target versions against the current brief. Consequently there are no finding IDs, severity/blocking assignments or corrective actions. No business decision or risk has been accepted by the reviewer.

## Review boundary

This is review of requirements, architecture, backlog and first-increment design feasibility. It does not establish that schemas, prompts, runtime, tests, demonstration or real Codex integration work. Independent implementation review and meaningful executed tests must supply that evidence. Changes to a target require a new version-specific review or an explicit independent delta review; this report must not silently be rebound to new hashes.

## Version provenance

Initial content came from the [preserved foundation source](../baseline/planning/reviews/design-review.md). Historical reviews bind their recorded source versions; moving/editing this working presentation does not create a new approval. Review manifests and links below still refer to their historical target artifacts.
