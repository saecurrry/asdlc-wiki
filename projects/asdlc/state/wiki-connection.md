# Central wiki connection

Confirmed by the user: [saecurrry/asdlc-wiki](https://github.com/saecurrry/asdlc-wiki) is the separate documentation, knowledge and sharing repository.

Local clone: `C:/Coding/asdlc-cloud/.asdlc-local/asdlc-wiki`. Branch: `main`; origin: `https://github.com/saecurrry/asdlc-wiki.git`. This clone is ignored by the tool repository and has its own Git history. Open its root as an existing Obsidian vault. The user subsequently authorised repository sync; this permission covers the current changes. Publication permissions remain scoped to user instructions.

The existing standards/, patterns/, knowledge/ and templates/ are preserved. Project documentation lives under projects/asdlc/. Current working documents live directly under project stage folders. Historical foundation evidence is referenced through immutable Git commit links; the duplicate baseline folder has been removed. Copies are not new approvals and template state is not executable evidence.

## Runtime compatibility

The current CLI accepts this clone through `--wiki .asdlc-local/asdlc-wiki`. It recognises the wiki as a separate Git repository and snapshots shared standards/patterns. The configured target remains this ASDLC tool repository; the project documentation ID is asdlc.

Template alignment completed locally: the wiki now uses the runtime's single project-root state.json and exact version 1 schemas. state/ documents the contract; the older split JSON drafts are preserved as inert legacy templates. The runtime owns generated project-status.md/raid.md after authorised init; archive editable draft views before replacement. No discovery or delivery stage is started by updating templates; supplied ASDLC requirements remain established.

Resume/check invocation after explicit project activation:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m asdlc --wiki .asdlc-local/asdlc-wiki --project asdlc resume
```

Current verification is configuration-only: initial state construction/schema validation against the actual clone, fixture=false, no state persisted and no approval fabricated. Historical tests and review evidence remain bound to their original versions. This connection document is a new configuration record, not a claim those older reviewers reviewed the wiki integration.
